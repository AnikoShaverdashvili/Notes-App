# Notes-App
 
I started creating a web application that allows users to manage their notes. To do this, I created an API using the ASP.NET Core framework, which acts like a backend server that stores all of the notes data.

Then, I created a front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that users can interact with in their web browsers. I wrote some additional code to connect the front-end to the API, so that users can perform actions like adding a new note or deleting an existing one.

By connecting the front-end to the API, I created a complete web application that allows users to easily manage their notes through a user-friendly interface.
